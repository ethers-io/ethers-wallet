ContractFactory
===============

Creating Instances
------------------

#### **new ***ethers* . **ContractFactory**( interface , bytecode [ , signer ] )

Creates a new instance of a **ContractFactory** for the contract described by the *interface* and *bytecode* initcode.


#### *ContractFactory* . **fromSolidity**( compilerOutput [ , signer ] ) => *[ContractFactory](/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/)*

Consumes the output of the Solidity compiler, extracting the ABI and bytecode from it, allowing for the various formats the solc compiler has emitted over its life.


#### *contractFactory* . **connect**( signer ) => *[Contract](/v5/api/contract/contract/)*

Returns a **new instance** of the ContractFactory with the same *interface* and *bytecode*, but with a different *signer*.


Properties
----------

#### *contractFactory* . **interface** => *[Interface](/v5/api/utils/abi/interface/)*

The [Contract](/v5/api/contract/contract/) interface.


#### *contractFactory* . **bytecode** => *string< [DataHexString](/v5/api/utils/bytes/#DataHexString) >*

The bytecode (i.e. initcode) that this **ContractFactory** will use to deploy the Contract.


#### *contractFactory* . **signer** => *[Signer](/v5/api/signer/#Signer)*

The [Signer](/v5/api/signer/#Signer) (if any) this ContractFactory will use to deploy instances of the Contract to the Blockchain.


Methods
-------

#### *contractFactory* . **attach**( address ) => *[Contract](/v5/api/contract/contract/)*

Return an instance of a [Contract](/v5/api/contract/contract/) attached to *address*. This is the same as using the [Contract constructor](/v5/api/contract/contract/#Contract--creating) with *address* and this the *interface* and *signerOrProvider* passed in when creating the ContractFactory.


#### *contractFactory* . **getDeployTransaction**( ...args [ , overrides ] ) => *[UnsignedTransaction](/v5/api/utils/transactions/#UnsignedTransaction)*

Returns the unsigned transaction which would deploy this Contract with *args* passed to the Contract's constructor.

If the optional *overrides* is specified, they can be used to override the endowment `value`, transaction `nonce`, `gasLimit` or `gasPrice`.


#### *contractFactory* . **deploy**( ...args [ , overrides ] ) => *Promise< [Contract](/v5/api/contract/contract/) >*

Uses the signer to deploy the Contract with *args* passed into the constructor and returns a Contract which is attached to the address where this contract **will** be deployed once the transaction is mined.

The transaction can be found at `contract.deployTransaction`, and no interactions should be made until the transaction is mined.

If the optional *overrides* is specified, they can be used to override the endowment `value`, transaction `nonce`, `gasLimit` or `gasPrice`.

// If your contract constructor requires parameters, the ABI
// must include the constructor
const abi = [

  "function value() view returns (uint)"
];

// The factory we use for deploying contracts
factory = new ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, signer)

// Deploy an instance of the contract
contract = await factory.deploy("ricmoo.eth", 42);
//<hide>
//! async contract
//</hide>

// The address is available immediately, but the contract
// is NOT deployed yet
contract.address
//!

// The transaction that the signer sent to deploy
contract.deployTransaction
//!

// Wait until the transaction is mined (i.e. contract is deployed)
//  - returns the receipt
//  - throws on failure (the reciept is on the error)
contract.deployTransaction.wait()
//!

// Now the contract is safe to interact with
contract.value()
